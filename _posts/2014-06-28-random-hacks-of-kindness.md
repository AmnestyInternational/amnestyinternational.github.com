We start building VISOR, a protest-data tool

-----

## Project VISOR at RHOK Ottawa Spring 2014

VISOR is a data platform for collecting, measuring, and distributing information from protest-type events. VISOR was born at Random Hacks of Kindness Ottawa 2014.

### The Need

Increased visibility of protest style events. Shortening information delays between events on the ground and analysis.

### Uses
- Tracking events in real time
- Documenting tear gas use
- Documenting kettling and mass arrests

### Data sources
- Twitter
- Instagram
- Firechat
- Anything with geotaging (Flickr, Weibo, SMS, wearable devices?)

### Data quality needs
- Correlating people based on their followers and followers relationship, creating social graph.
- Filtering data by geographic proximity
- Representing aggregated data
- Robust solution which can resist attack (Google doc, github, etc.)

### Possible end-uses 
- Easy and clean data feeds for journalists and human rights monitors
- Simple charts, graphs and maps made with sheetsee.js
- Complex charts, graphs and maps made with D3.js
- Interactive maps made with mapbox or leaflet.js
- Data-analysis, with R or similar
- Web applications for protest watchers
- Mobile apps for protesters
