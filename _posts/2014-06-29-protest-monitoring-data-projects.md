title: VISOR, Protest Data, and Social Media Monitoring Tools
---

Human rights and data analysis projects that inspired VISOR

-----

[VISOR](https://github.com/AmnestyInternational/visor) is a social media monitoring tool developed to help track and understand protests. It collects, stores, cleans and filters data, and outputs it is a variety of useful formats.

### Digital protest tools

There are several interesting protest tools in use today (and one not) that we had in mind while starting this project:

1. The [Natalia wristband](http://natalia.civilrightsdefenders.org/#bracelet), from Civil Rights Defenders, is a GPS and communications enabled strap. Worn by an individual, it emits a distress alert when triggered (by being removed, for example)
1. [Panic Button](https://panicbutton.io/), from Amnesty International, is an Android app that sends out a distress alert when triggered
1. Sukey was an anti-kettling, protest-mapping platform. It allowed coordination between protesters on the ground with a sort of "air traffic control" online. Sukey is no longer active
1. [Witness.org](http://witness.org/) provides tools for shooting and disseminating protest video.

These projects focus on personal security or qualitative observation during protests. We are interested in augmenting these tools with quantitative, big-picture, techniques. 

### Social media monitoring

We are working towards a predicitve model for protests. In part, this is to understand how to keep protests safe and effective. We also want to understand and raise the visibility of messages from protesters:

1. [NoHomoPhobes](http://www.nohomophobes.com/#!/today/) is a social media monitoring project that tracks homophobic language online. It has a simple, direct interface that beautifully illustrates a defined message.  
1. [twXplorer](http://twxplorer.knightlab.com/) is a platform for seeing what is being talked about locally, on Twitter.
1. [Dataminr](http://www.dataminr.com/) is a powerful commercial social media monitoring and analysis tool

### Data Analysis and Reporting

An important part of VISOR is making data available in easily used formats. The information we collect is output to Google Spreadsheets, which in turn produce JSON feeds. From this supply, a wide variety of applications is possible.

We also see the use of sophistacated data-analysis tools, like the [PANDA Project](http://pandaproject.net/) or data manipulation with languages like R.

### Stay tuned

VISOR is an ongoing project!
